# Interventional Catheter Segmentation
## Project Overview
This project focused on developing a deep learning model, DSCNet, to improve catheter segmentation in endovascular surgery.

## Key Details
- **Objective:** Enhance catheter manipulation accuracy in surgeries.
- **Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, DSCNet.
- **Achievements:** IoU of 0.94, 98% accuracy.

## Workflow
1. **Problem Definition:** Segmenting catheters in medical images.
2. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting datasets.
3. **Model Development:** Implemented DSCNet to handle segmentation tasks.
4. **Results:** Achieved superior accuracy compared to existing models.
